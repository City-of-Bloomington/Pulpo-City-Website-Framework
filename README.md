# ![Pulpo CWF Logo](http://i.imgur.com/ib7yALz.png) Pulpo Municipal Framework

Pulpo is our attempt at building a pattern library & design system framework for city websites. We found in redesigning our own municipal website, there is not a great starting place for communities undertaking this task in-house. Pulpo is meant to provide you with a starter kit of tools aimed at helping you track & utilize best practices en route to launching your own site -- wherever you are in the process of development. 

## General steps:

  - Foundation
    - [Pattern Library](docs/designmanual.md)
    - [Vision and Goals](docs/vision.md)
    - [Information Architecture](docs/ia.md)
    - User Stories Template
    - [Style Guide](docs/contentstyle.md)
    - [Platform Selection](docs/platform.md)
  - Assembly 
    - [Color Palette](https://bloomington.in.gov/mybloomington/style.html)
    - City-government specific page templates
    - Platform Installation / Configuration 
  - Implementation
    - Rewrite and Migrate Content
    - Design CSS / HTML 

Many of these steps can happen in parallel. Additionally, many of the steps are iterative; don't be surprised if you find your way back at the beginning! It's good to revisit and revise these steps. 

A notable omission is "integration". Enabling your city's website talk to other systems is a good idea, eventually. However, this is a rabbit hole and can easily distract from the main goal.

## Why the name Pulpo?

**Pulpo** is the Spanish word for Octopus, a creature with eight tentacles. We felt this was a fitting metaphor for government websites, which serve a diverse array of stakeholders and require a deft set of hands manage them properly.
