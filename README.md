# City Website Framework

Building a good city website is challenging. This is a shared space to track best practices and processes for the task. 

## General steps:

  - Foundation
    - Design Manual
    - Writing Style Guide
    - Vision and Goals
    - [Information Architecture](docs/ia.md)
    - User Stories
    - [Platform Selection](docs/platform.md)
  - Assembly 
    - Wireframes
    - Page Types
    - Platform Installation / Configuration 
  - Implementation
    - Rewrite and Migrate Content
    - Design CSS / HTML 

Many of these steps can happen in parallel. Additionally, many of the steps are iterative; don't be surprised if you find your way back at the beginning! It's good to revisit and revise these steps. 

A notable omission is "integration". Enabling your city's website talk to other systems is a good idea, eventually. However, this is a rabbit hole and can easily distract from the main goal.
