**City of Bloomington (BLOOMINGTON.IN.GOV)
Content Style Guide**

Drafted September 13, 2016

## **Writing Goals and Principles**

With every piece of content we publish, we aim to:

* **Respect. **Ensure content is never patronizing. Be considerate and inclusive.

* **Guide. **Think of each piece of content as an extended feature of our customer service outreach to citizens. Whether you’re creating website content, apps, or replying to an email, communicating in a friendly and helpful way.

* **Empower. **Help citizens improve their experience with government through language that provides direct access to the services and information they seek.

* **Educate. **Tell constituents what they need to know, not just what we want to say. Give them the exact information they need, where possible, along with contact information/location to find out more in-person.

In order to achieve these goals, we ensure our content is:

* **Clear.** Understand the topic you’re writing about. Use simple words and sentences.

* **Useful.** Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?

* **Consistent. **Write like a human. Limit acronyms, abbreviations and other unhelpful jargon that makes it harder for people to understand what we’re talking about. 

* **Appropriate.** Write in a way that suits the situation. Just like you do in face-to-face conversations, adapt your tone depending on who you’re writing to and what you’re writing about.

## **Voice and Tone**

One way we write empowering content is by being aware of our voice and our tone. This section explains the difference between voice and tone, and lays out the elements of each as they apply to the City of Bloomington website. 

What’s the difference between voice and tone? Think of it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might use one tone when you're out to dinner with your closest friends, and a different tone when you're in a meeting with your boss. Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t want to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing. 

As a local government, the City of Bloomington has a more immediate relationship with its constituents than other government entities. Our constituents often visit us on our front lawn — and sometimes our work ends up on theirs.
