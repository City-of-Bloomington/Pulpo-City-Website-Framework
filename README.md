# Pulpo City Website Framework

Pulpo is our attempt at building a framework for city websites. We found in redesigning our own municipal website, there is not a great starting place for communities undertaking this task in-house. Pulpo is meant to provide you with a starter kit of tools aimed at helping you track & utilize best practices en route to launching your own site -- wherever you are in the process of development. 

## General steps:

  - Foundation
    - A living style guide and pattern library
    - Vision and Goals
    - [Information Architecture](docs/ia.md)
    - User Stories
    - [Platform Selection](docs/platform.md)
  - Assembly 
    - Wireframes
    - City-government specific page templates
    - Platform Installation / Configuration 
  - Implementation
    - Rewrite and Migrate Content
    - Design CSS / HTML 

Many of these steps can happen in parallel. Additionally, many of the steps are iterative; don't be surprised if you find your way back at the beginning! It's good to revisit and revise these steps. 

A notable omission is "integration". Enabling your city's website talk to other systems is a good idea, eventually. However, this is a rabbit hole and can easily distract from the main goal.
