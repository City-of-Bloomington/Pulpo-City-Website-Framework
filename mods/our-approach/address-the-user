title: Address the user
---

Content on government sites often makes a direct appeal to the public to get involved or take action.

Address the user as _you_ whenever possible. For example:

> You can email us at [City of Bloomington@in.gov](mailto:City of Bloomington@in.gov) or find us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CityBloomington).

> Learn more about starting your MyBloomington account.

If you’re creating content for multiple users—such as patients and their caregivers—address the primary user as _you_ and refer to secondary users by their roles or titles.

We recommend against using the word _citizens_ when talking about the public.
