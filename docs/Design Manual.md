# City of Bloomington (BLOOMINGTON.IN.GOV)
Design Manual

Drafted September 14, 2016

The City of Bloomington website strives to better serve consumers by using plain language; relying on simple, user-friendly design; and providing easy access to information that can help consumers make informed decisions.

This Design Manual is an open-source resource for city staff to produce effective and visually-consistent products that are easy for consumers to access, use, and understand. The Manual includes our design principles, guidelines for user experience, visual identity standards, and code snippets for common user interface elements. The Manual will continue to evolve as we learn what works best for the city residents and the people we serve.

## Design principles

1. Start with needs

2. Do less

3. Design with data

4. Do the hard work to make it simple

5. Iterate. Then iterate again

6. Build for inclusion

7. Understand context

8. Build digital services, not websites

9. Be consistent not uniform

10. Be transparent; it makes things better

## Brand guidelines

The City of Bloomington digital collateral are built and designed to promote a clear and trusted relationship with consumers and enable them to live better financial lives. These guidelines represent the most up-to-date visual expression of the City of Bloomington website.

#### Color Palette

The primary color palette for city web properties is blue, keeping consistent with city branding in print and on vehicles. This document seeks simply to establish a consistent visual brand for digital properties. 

###### Primary colors

###### Background colors

These colors are used primarily for background wells and fields. When alternating between tones, be sure to use enough tones providing enough contrast between adjacent wells.

###### Secondary colors

These colors are used primarily as accent colors, and should be used to add variety to page content and illustrations. They should never overpower the core brand colors.

#### Typography (Fonts)

Typography helps maintain a consistent brand identity internally and on public-facing materials. **[Nimbus San**s](https://typekit.com/fonts/nimbus-sans)** **is the primary typeface for all city digital collateral. Recommended use: 48 px for headers, 18 px for content. **[FF Tis**a](https://typekit.com/fonts/ff-tisa) is the secondary typeface, best used for body copy and other small text. In instances where neither font is available, **Helvetica Neue** can be substituted. For web fonts, use **Roboto** as a primary typeface unless otherwise specified.

## Global elements

Our Global elements section contains structural elements that can be used to create the foundation of a webpage as well as elements that appear on every page. These elements are part of City of Bloomington’s [Factory Number One](https://github.com/City-of-Bloomington/factory-number-one), a pattern library built by in-house designers and developers to help us create visually consistent web products as easily as possible.

Page templates reflect common page types that we use within our Content Management System. They are documented here primarily for easy reference by our designers and secondarily as inspiration for anyone creating a system of components.

## Page components

## Microsite Definition and Policy

Microsites are modular, one-page sites that exist within the structure of the website. Unlike regular web templates, they might have flexibility relative to their design and navigation due to a need to have pages that require more creative freedom or serve primarily as marketing pages. 

## Reuse of open-source style guides

Much of the guidance contained in the City of Bloomington design manual is adapted from design, code and patterns from other civic & corporate guides including:

* Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s [Design Manual](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/)

* UK Government Digital Service [content and publishing guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/topic/government-digital-guidance/content-publishing)
